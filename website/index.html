      <div class="bigpill">
        <h2>The Web<br>is Broken</h2>
        <p>When you use a web app today, you usually connect to its developers' servers.  This is
          backwards, and leaves them in control.
      </div>

      <div class="bigpill">
        <p>Sandstorm makes it easy to run web apps on your own server.  Bring their apps to your
          data, and make sure they don't do anything you don't like.</p>
        <h2>Sandstorm<br>puts you in<br>Control</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="bigpill">
        <h2>More than<br>just a VM</h2>
        <p>No command lines, no configuration files. Apps are installed through an app-store-like web interface.
          And, most importantly, every app runs in a separate secure sandbox, so an evil app cannot take
          down your server.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why have your own server?</h2>

      <p>It's all about control...

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <h3>All Your Data in One Place</h3>
          <p>Why should your personal data be scattered around the internet, stored on computers
            belonging to dozens of companies?  It's your data, not theirs.  Keep it all in one place.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>No Disappearing Apps</h3>
          <p>Apps running on your server do not <a href="http://reader.google.com">disappear</a> when
            the developer stops supporting them.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>No Spying / Data Mining</h3>
          <p>Sandstorm apps can only talk to the outside world with your explicit permission.  That
            means they can't secretly
            <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57620658-75/microsoft-sniffed-bloggers-hotmail-account-to-trace-leak/">spy</a>
            on you nor develop an <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">advertising profile</a> from your data.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>End Walled Gardens</h3>
          <p>Your apps shouldn't only integrate with other apps from the same developer.  They should
            integrate with whatever apps <i>you</i> choose to use.  Sandstorm makes it easy.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Stay Secure</h3>
          <p>Some developers are bad at security.  With apps running in a secure sandbox on a server
            you control, you can defend yourself against poorly-written apps &mdash; and even
            malicious ones.
        </div>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>But what's in it for the developers?</h2>

      <p>As it turns out, lots of stuff...

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Zero Operational Costs</h3>
          <p>You don't have to pay for servers nor carry a pager.  Just make your app work, put it
            on the app store, and relax.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Just One Machine</h3>
          <p>Since every end user is running their own instance of your app, you never need to worry
            about scaling.  You can pretend your app only runs on a single machine.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Security is Built-in</h3>
          <p>You don't have to implement login.  You don't even have to implement sharing &mdash;
            Sandstorm does that for you.  You can even export APIs and integrate with other apps
            without thinking about OAuth.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Any Tech Stack</h3>
          <p>Sandstorm is a native-code sandbox.  It supports any Linux-based technology stack.  Use
            whatever language you prefer.  Easily port existing code.
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Level Playing Field</h3>
          <p>When users have control, they are more willing to use apps from developers they don't
            already know and trust.  This means new, small developers can break into the market
            more easily.

      <h2>So where do I get it?</h2>

      <p>We're still in the early days of development, but you can start playing with Sandstorm
        now!

      <div class="row-wide">
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Use Our Servers...</h3>
          <p>We offer managed Sandstorm instances.  Starting in March 2014, this service is in
            closed alpha testing.  As we ramp up, we will send invites to people on the mailing
            list on a first-come-first-serve basis &mdash; sign up below!

        <div class="column">
          <h3>...Or Run Your Own</h3>
          <p>Sandstorm is Open Source Software.  You can find the code and installation instructions
            at <a href="http://github.com/kentonv/sandstorm">Github</a>.  You will need a Linux
            machine and an understanding of Linux system administration to set up your server, but
            you can then share that server with friends and family who do not know Linux.
