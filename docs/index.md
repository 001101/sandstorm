# Sandstorm documentation

## What is Sandstorm? See [sandstorm.io](https://sandstorm.io)

Sandstorm is an open source platform for personal servers.

Sandstorm lets you run your own server and install apps like
EtherCalc, GitLab, Etherpad, LibreBoard, and more as easily as you'd
install apps on your phone.

Sandstorm is in the very early stages of development. We want
developers to start playing with it, but please don't rely on it for
mission-critical data or security yet.

## First steps

Are you new to Sandstorm, packaging Sandstorm apps, or running your
own server? This is the place to start.

* **Totally new:** [Overview](overview.md) | [Try the demo](https://demo.sandstorm.io/) | [Installing Sandstorm on a server](install.md)
* **Packaging tutorial:** [Learn how to package a web app for Sandstorm from Mac OS or Linux](vagrant-spk/packaging-tutorial.md)
* **Get involved:** [Learn how to make a positive difference in the Sandstorm community](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Get-Involved)

## App packaging

If you learn the concepts and skills to take you beyond the
introductory packaging tutorial, check out the following:

* Sandstorm platform overview: See the [Sandstorm App Developer Handbook](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Sandstorm-App-Developer-Handbook) for information on app isolation, granularity, writable `/var`, and more.
* App packaging with vagrant-spk: [Overview](vagrant-spk/index.md) | [Installation](vagrant-spk/installation.md) | [Customizing & understanding vagrant-spk](vagrant-spk/customizing.md) | [Platform stacks for Meteor, Python, PHP, and DIY](vagrant-spk/platform-stacks.md)


## Reference documentation

We call Sandstorm a _platform_ because it provides concepts,
capabilities, and APIs that apps can use. To learn more about these,
read the [GitHub wiki](http://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki).
