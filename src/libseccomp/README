This directory is an Ekam-style dependency import. See:

    https://github.com/sandstorm-io/ekam

Since libseccomp is not Ekam-clean, we do a little hack. Normally, configure.h
is generated by the configure script, but we don't want to run that script
here. So we provide our own configure.h. It turns out that there's only one
option in there that's actually used and that option doesn't actually matter,
so, whatever.

Unfortunately, the only way to provide our own configure.h that is available
to all the seccomp *.c files but is not directly includable by the entire
world is to have it be in the same directory, which means we can't symlink
the whole libseccomp/src directory; we instead must symlink each file
separately. Dang.

Luckily libseccomp doesn't appear to change much. We'll just update things
if there's a breakage.

As a second hack, we symlink the original source tree's seccomp.h.in to
include/seccomp.h. This means that the version numbers won't have been
properly substituted. Luckily we don't use those, so whatever.
